You can choose between this extruder or bowden.

Update 08_09_2018:
+ Added file extruder_parte1_v2.stl that you can print, and you do not need to use the sensorjumper.stl, but it does not work with transparent filament, if you have transparent filament you can unplug the sensor, but it will trigger. 
= Updated file sensorjumper.stl and extruder_parte1.stl to work better.
